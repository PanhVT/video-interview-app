# Web Interview Recorder

This is a browser-based interview system with up to five questions.
For each question, the application records a short video (camera + microphone) and uploads it immediately to the backend server.

The system follows a client-server architecture, communicates via HTTP/HTTPS, and requires camera/mic permissions from the browser.
